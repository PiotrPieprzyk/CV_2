						My response: Learning
					</h4>
					<p>
						I have been given three months to learn under the supervision of one
						of my colleagues. At that time, I spend 8 - 12 hours learning each
						day. I went through courses such as: "JavaScript - The Complete
						Guide 2020" and "Vue - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian
						Schwarzm√ºller.
					</p>
					<p>
						I read documentation on<primary> MDN</primary>,
						<primary>Vue.js</primary>, and <primary> Medium articles</primary> .
						Simultaneously I prepared many small projects in order to gain
						practical knowledge.
					</p>

					<h4 class="bold">
						DOING
					</h4>
					<p>
						I was entrusted with many tasks and had to
						<primary>independently organize</primary> my work schedule. Subsides
						prepared by me are: Contact, FAQ, Regulations, Complaints, Payment,
						Delivery, Ask the pharmacist, and Withdrawal from the contract and
						more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout all this work, I have developed
						<primary>three main skills</primary>
						. The ability to plan, create functions and components, and create
						connections.

						PLANING
					</h4>
					<img src="@/assets/projects/dev/gemini/detailed_plan.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						This is one of my favorite activities. It allows me to know
						<primary>exactly what to do</primary>. The list of tasks turned out
						to be super useful, especially when I was returning to work after
						the weekend.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another advantage of planning my day was the
						<primary>reduction of the time needed to complete the task</primary
						>. Each saved hour I spent reading study material and I was able to
						develop all the time.

					<h4 class="bold">
						COMPONENTS
					</h4>
					<img src="@/assets/projects/dev/gemini/Components.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Another useful skill is writing reusable code. After creating a few
						components, I was producing pages faster. Writing time was often
						reduced by up to 40%. Additionally, a code containing components was
						much shorter and easier to
						<primary>maintain</primary>.

						CONNECTION
					</h4>
					<p>
						I learned a lot from collaborating with NXO and Gemini Teams.
						Firstly I became familiar with <primary> Agile workflow</primary>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second thing I learned from working with Gemini is the ability
						to use <primary>Figma</primary>! Thanks to my colleagues I got to
						know about the tool and tried it myself. It quickly became my main
						design tool. Additionally, starting with Figma, I found out how
						interesting the design process itself is and decided to develop
						myself in this area.

						OVERVIEW
					</h4>
					<p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Vue
						</li>

							Less / Sass
						</li>
						<li>
							Jira & Agile
						</li>
